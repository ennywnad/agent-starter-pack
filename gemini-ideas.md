# Gemini's Idea: The CI/CD Triage Agent

## High-Level Concept

An autonomous agent that automatically investigates failed CI/CD pipeline runs, determines the likely cause, and posts a summary report to a developer Slack channel or creates a GitHub issue.

## The Problem it Solves

Developers spend a significant amount of time investigating why a build or test failed in a CI/CD pipeline. This often involves manually sifting through thousands of lines of logs to find the root cause, which can be a repetitive and time-consuming task, especially for common or flaky failures. This agent acts as an automated first line of defense, saving developer time and accelerating remediation.

## The Agent's Workflow

1.  **Trigger:** The agent is triggered by a webhook from a CI/CD system (like Google Cloud Build or GitHub Actions) whenever a pipeline fails.
2.  **Analyze Build Logs:** The agent uses a tool to fetch and read the full log output from the failed pipeline run. It scans the log for specific error messages, stack traces, or keywords (e.g., `Error:`, `failed`, `timeout`).
3.  **Internal Knowledge Search (RAG):** It takes the identified error message and performs a search against an internal knowledge base (e.g., a Vertex AI Search datastore populated with past incident reports, internal wikis, or previous build failure resolutions). This helps identify if the failure is a known issue.
4.  **External Knowledge Search:** If the internal search yields no results, the agent uses a web search tool to look for the error message on public forums like Stack Overflow or GitHub issues, looking for common causes or solutions.
5.  **Synthesize and Report:** The agent synthesizes the information from the logs and its search results into a concise, helpful report. The report would include:
    *   **The specific error message.**
    *   **A link to the failed pipeline.**
    *   **A summary of the likely cause** (e.g., "This appears to be a timeout in the integration test suite.").
    *   **A suggested action** (e.g., "This is similar to a past incident [link] that was resolved by restarting the test environment. Suggest re-running the job.").
    *   **Links to relevant internal or external resources.**
6.  **Take Action:** The agent posts this formatted report to a designated Slack channel (e.g., `#build-failures`) and/or creates a new GitHub issue, tagging the relevant team or individuals who last committed to the codebase.

## Why it's a Great Fit for the Agent Starter Pack

This use case perfectly aligns with the starter pack's mission to build **production-ready agents**.

*   **Focus on Core Logic:** You can focus on building the agent's reasoning process and the specific tools (`read_build_log`, `post_to_slack`), while the starter pack provides the robust foundation for deployment, serving, and observability.
*   **Leverages MLOps:** It's an agent built for the MLOps lifecycle itself, demonstrating the value of AI in the development process.
*   **Real Business Value:** It directly addresses developer productivity, a key metric for any engineering organization.
*   **Evaluation is Key:** The starter pack's evaluation framework would be critical for measuring the agent's accuracy. A good metric would be "What percentage of failures did the agent correctly diagnose?"

## Suggested Agent Template

The **`agentic_rag`** or **`crewai_coding_crew`** templates would be excellent starting points. `agentic_rag` provides the core RAG capability for searching the internal knowledge base, while `crewai` could be used to orchestrate a more complex workflow with multiple specialized agents (e.g., a "Log Analyzer Agent" and a "Knowledge Searcher Agent").
